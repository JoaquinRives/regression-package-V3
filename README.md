# regression_package_V3

This package is a house-price prediction model that I am building using pipelines and custom
transformers by inheritance from sklearn.base. I have also added some testing and logging.

The purpose of creating this package is just for trainning and to gain experince building packages
and applying some good practices (pipelines, logging and testing).
